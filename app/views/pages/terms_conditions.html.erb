<li><strong>Consent to Electronic Transactions and Disclosures.</strong> Because you are using the Internet on the Site and Portal, it is necessary for you to consent to transact business with us online and electronically. As part of doing business with us and for all loans WebBank, a Utah industrial bank that is the lender of said loans (“WBK”), we also need you to consent to our giving you certain Disclosures electronically, either via our Site or to the email address you provide to us. By agreeing to the Terms, you agree to receive electronically all documents, communications, notices, contracts, and agreements—arising from or relating to you—regarding any loans you may request or receive, your use as Portal User on our Site, any funding, the servicing of any loan, if funded as a borrower (each, a “Disclosure”), from us or WBK.</li><br>

<li><strong>Scope of Electronic Consent.</strong> Your consent to receive Disclosures and transact business electronically. Our agreement to do so applies to any transactions to which such Disclosures relate, whether between you and Flipbank or between you and WBK. Your consent will remain in effect as long as you are a Portal User and, if you are no longer a Portal User, will continue until such a time as all Disclosures relevant to transactions that occurred while you were a Portal User have been made.</li><br>

<li><strong>Consenting to Do Business Electronically.</strong> Before you decide to do business electronically with Flipbank or WBK, you should consider whether you have the required hardware and software capabilities described below.</li><br>

<li><strong>Hardware and Software Requirements.</strong> To access and retain Disclosures electronically, you must satisfy the following computer hardware and software requirements: access to the Internet; an email account and related software capable of receiving email through the Internet; a web browser which is SSL-compliant and supports secure sessions (such as Internet Explorer 8.0 or above iOS, Firefox, Chrome, or the equivalent software); and hardware capable of running this software.</li><br>

<li><strong>Consent to Telephone Calls.</strong> You also expressly consent to receiving servicing, collection and other calls and messages, including auto-dialed and pre-recorded message calls, and SMS messages (including text messages) from us, our affiliates, marketing partners, agents, and others calling at their request or on their behalf, at any telephone numbers that you have provided or may provide in the future (including any cellular telephone numbers). Your cellular or mobile telephone provider will charge you according to the type of plan you carry.</li><br>

<li><strong>Additional Mobile Technology Requirements.</strong> If you are accessing our site and the Disclosures electronically via a mobile device (such as a smart phone, tablet, and the like), in addition to the above requirements you must make sure that you have software on your mobile device that allows you to print and save the Disclosures presented to you during the application process. These applications can be found for most mobile devices in the device’s respective “app store.” If you do not have these capabilities on your mobile device, please access this Site or Portal through a device that provides these capabilities.</li><br>

<li><strong>Withdrawing Consent.</strong> You may withdraw your consent to receive Disclosures electronically by contacting us at the address below. However, once you have withdrawn your consent you will not be able to post any funding requests on our Site. If you have a pending request on our Site, we will terminate it and remove it from our system. If you have already received funding, all previously agreed to terms and conditions will remain in effect, and we will send Disclosures to your verified business address provided during registration.</li><br>
